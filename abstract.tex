Main Sequence (MS) stellar ages will play a big role in the next generation of
astronomy.
Useful to exoplaneteers and galactic archaeologists alike, this relatively
under-exploited stellar property is limited by the precision of current dating
techniques.
The work presented in this thesis moves us towards a greater understanding of
rotation period decay in MS stars as a proxy for stellar ages.
Inferring stellar ages from rotation periods is called gyrochronology and it
is the {\it only} dating method with the potential to provide the ages of
hundreds of thousands of stars.
Unfortunately it suffers from being poorly calibrated as the sample of cool,
MS stars with precise ages is extremely sparse.
Using light curves of spotted, rotating MS, FGK stars with asteroseismic ages
from the \kepler\ spacecraft, I attempted to recalibrate the relation between
rotation period, colour and age.
I demonstrate that the simple, `straight line' gyrochronology relations used
in the past are no longer adequate to explain the new, asteroseismic sample.
I raise new questions about the power of gyrochronology---does it continue to
provide age information out to old ages?
To answer this question, we need to exploit the new data from the \ktwo\ (the
repurposed \kepler\ mission).
\ktwo\ has observed (and is still observing) several open clusters and
asteroseismic field stars which may provide new insight into stellar
rotational evolution.
Unfortunately, systematic features in \ktwo\ light curves produced by
\kepler's reduced pointing precision inhibit the detection of astrophysical
signals in the data.
These systematic features can be removed by modelling and subtracting them
from the time series, `detrending', however this process can remove some
signals and can even inject noise.
For this reason I developed a method for detecting periodic signals in \ktwo\
light curves without detrending: the Systematics-Insensitive Periodogram
(SIP).
This method is particularly useful for red giant asteroseismology.
Precise ages can be inferred for oscillating red giants using the SIP and will
be useful for galactic archaeology and open cluster age inference.
Star spots and acoustic (p-mode) oscillations are not the only mechansims
that produce variability in dwarfs and giants.
A combination of asteroseismic pulsations and granulation on the stellar
surface produces variability on short timescales.
It has been shown that the amplitude of this short-term variability, called
`flicker' is strongly correlated with both surface gravity and stellar
density and the relations between flicker and these two physical properties
have been calibrated previously.
However, there is substantial additional scatter in these relations, not
accounted for by the observational uncertainties.
I provide a new calibration of these relations which models this level of
additional, astrophysical variance using hierarchical probabilistic inference.
In the last chapter of this thesis I return to the problem of stellar rotation
period inference.
Current methods for rotation period inference can produce inaccurate,
imprecise periods with poorly approximated uncertainties and often without
uncertainties altogether.
I present a new method for inferring precise, accurate, probabilistic rotation
periods with accurate uncertainties using Gaussian processes.
Although expensive to compute, this method is ideal for applying to individual
targets.
I hope to continue to develop this method and apply it to a large ensemble
light curves from \kepler\ and other photometric surveys in the future.
