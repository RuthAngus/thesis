\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chapter:conclusions}

In chapter \ref{chapter:gyro} I used new results from \kepler\
asteroseismology to recalibrate the relation between rotation period, age and
colour.
The light curves of several cool dwarf, Solar-like oscillators were analysed
by \citet{Chaplin2014} who provide a catalogue of ages for these targets via
the methods described in \textsection \ref{section:asteroseismology} of
chapter \ref{chapter:intro}.
We used rotation periods of these stars from \citet{Garcia2014} who measure
the periodicity of signals in \kepler\ light curves using the ACF and wavelet
methods described in \textsection \ref{rotation}.
We fit a gyrochronology model to these data, of the form
\begin{equation}
P = A^n \times a(B-V-c)^b,
\end{equation}
\label{eq:Barnes2007_2}
where $P$ is rotation period (in days),
$A$ is age (in Myr), $B$ and $V$ are B and V band magnitudes respectively and
$a$, $b$, $c$ and $n$ are dimensionless free parameters.
We found evidence to suggest that this function does not provide a good fit to
the data and that some old \kepler\ asteroseismic targets are more rapidly
rotating that expected, given their age and colour.
\citet{Vansaders2016} present an adaptation to their theoretical model which
{\it is} able to reproduce the trends in this data set.
They suggest that there is a critical Rossby number ($Ro=2.16$) at which the
magnetic dynamo that drives angular momentum loss shuts off.
New rotation periods from the repurposed \kepler\ mission, \ktwo\ may shed
light on this controversial topic.

In chapter \ref{chapter:sip} I present a method for searching for periodic
signals (\eg rotation periods) without detrending.
The pointing precision of \kepler\ was dramatically reduced when its third
reaction wheel broke.
\ktwo\ light curves are contaminated with high amplitude systematic features
as a result.
Detrending these light curves is essential in order to search for exoplanets
or measure stellar rotation periods.
Instead of detrending, we model the noise and the signal simultaneously and
marginalise over the noise model.
A noise model is constructed by decomposing all \ktwo\ light curves from
campaign 1 into a set of orthogonal basis vectors called `Eigen Light Curves'
(ELCs).
The Systematics-Insensitive Periodogram (SIP) uses a linear combination of
150 of these ELCs to model a light curve while simulataneously fitting a
sinusoid to the data at a given frequency.
Finding the amplitudes of the best-fit sinusoids over a grid of frequencies
produces a SIP.
The SIP is particularly effective for red giant asteroseismology as these
signals are typically sinusoidal and plagued by a six-hour thruster firing
signal that most detrending algorithms are unable to remove.
The capabilities of the SIP are limited for rotation period inference as
it is difficult to separate systematics from physical signals on long
timescales and because a sinusoid is an imperfect model for stellar rotation.

In chapter \ref{chapter:GP} I present a new method for inferring precise and
accurate rotation periods from \kepler\ light curves using Gaussian processes.
I compare the GP method to the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and ACF methods,
finding it to be more accurate and precise than both.
In addition it provides accurate uncertainties because full a posterior PDF of
the rotation period parameter is explored.
Unfortunately, while this method works well on noise-free simulations, it is
currently extremely computationally expensive when applied to noisy light
curves.
It is therefore currently most useful for individual targets rather than large
ensembles of light curves.

In the final chapter of this thesis I use \kepler\ flicker estimates and
asteroseismology data to recalibrate the relation between flicker, surface
gravity and stellar density.
These relations are not deterministic, although they have been treated as such
in the past and there is significant intrinsic scatter that is not accounted
for by the observational uncertainties.
I use hierarchical probabilistic modelling to quantify  model these relations
and quantify the additional scatter.

I began this thesis by introducing the \kepler\ spacecraft which has provided
all the data used in this work.
I would like to conclude by saying that, in my opinion, \kepler's legacy has
to be the greatest of any astronomical instrument ever built.
Not just for exoplanets but for stellar astrophysics too.
\kepler\ has revived the astronomical communities general interest in stars:
after all, one can only understand an exoplanet as well as one understands the
star that it orbits.
Were it not for \kepler, this thesis would look very different and I, for one,
am grateful for the unique challenges posed by its rich, unrivalled data set.
