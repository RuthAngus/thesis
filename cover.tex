\author{Ruth Angus}
% If you wish to list your previous degrees on the cover page, use the
% previous degrees command:
%       \prevdegrees{A.A., Harvard University (1985)}
% You can use the \\ command to list multiple previous degrees
%       \prevdegrees{B.S., University of California (1978) \\
%                    S.M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1981)}
\department{Subdepartment of Astrophysics}

% If the thesis is for two degrees simultaneously, list them both
% separated by \and like this:
% \degree{Doctor of Philosophy \and Master of Science}
\degree{Dphil in Astrophysics}

% As of the 2007-08 academic year, valid degree months are September,
% February, or June.  The default is June.

%% By default, the thesis will be copyrighted to MIT.  If you need to copyright
%% the thesis to yourself, just specify the `vi' documentclass option.  If for
%% some reason you want to exactly specify the copyright notice text, you can
%% use the \copyrightnoticetext command.

% If there is more than one supervisor, use the \supervisor command
% once for each.

% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need
% something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify
% the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage
% environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space.
% The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.  The dotted
% lines for the signatures are made with the \signature command.
\maketitle

% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

%% You can either \input (*not* \include) your abstract file, or you can put
%% the text of the abstract directly between the \begin{abstractpage} and
%% \end{abstractpage} commands.

% First copy: start a new page, and save the page number.
\cleardoublepage
% Uncomment the next line if you do NOT want a page number on your
% abstract and acknowledgments pages.
% \pagestyle{empty}
\setcounter{savepage}{\thepage}
\begin{abstractpage}
\input{abstract}
\end{abstractpage}

% Additional copy: start a new page, and reset the page number.  This way,
% the second copy of the abstract is not counted as separate pages.
% Uncomment the next 6 lines if you need two copies of the abstract
% page.
% \setcounter{page}{\thesavepage}

\section*{Acknowledgments}

More than anyone I would like to thank my Dphil supervisor, Suzanne Aigrain,
who has been infinitely supportive over the last four years.
She has always had time to provide excellent advice and has encouraged
independent development, building my confidence as an emerging scientist.
Over four years of working with Suzanne my admiration of her expert knowledge
has only grown and our working relationship has been unceasingly wonderful.
This is a testament of Suzanne's superb advising style.
Because of Suzanne's love of statistics and incredible foresight she suggested
I attend a summer school on `statistics with \kepler\ data' at the SAMSI
institute in North Carolina, USA in the first year of my Dphil.
At this summer school I met the collaborators of my future.
I would like to thank David Hogg, Eric Ford, Rebekkah Dawson, Ben Montet,
Angie Wolfgang and the whole SAMSI working group for providing wonderful
advice and expert guidance throughout my Dphil.
A special thanks goes to John Johnson for supporting my time at the
Harvard-Smithsonian CFA where I learnt more than I ever expected to about
exoplanets and observational astronomy.
Thank you to John's entire group, particularly Ben Montet and Andrew
Vanderburg for so many stimulating discussions at group meetings.
To Dave Latham: thank you for being a wonderful mentor at the CFA, twice.
I would like to thank all my collaborators and coauthors: Suzanne Aigrain, Amy
McQuillan, Dan Foreman-Mackey, John Johnson, David Kipping, Suzanne Hawley,
Jim Davenport, Derek Buzazi and S{\o}ren Meibom.
Finally I would like to thank Dan Foreman-Mackey, a major influence on all my
work, and my parents for being unwaveringly supportive and excellent proof
readers.
